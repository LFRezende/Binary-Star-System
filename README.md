# Binary-Star-Simulator
## Introduction

This is a simple project which I developed when I was bored in a bus, while I came back home.
What the user must do is simple:

1. Add the coordinates specific to each body  A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2). All of them are in meters (I.S.).
2. Add their respective velocities (vectorial velocities).
3. Add their initial accelerations (also vectorial).
4. Input the clock (time to update the values Ts) - the smaller the Ts, the more accurate is the plot.

## And that's it! :D
